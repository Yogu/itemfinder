itemfinder
==========

Just died in Minecraft, and can't find your stuff? This tool will show it to you.

[Download latest version](https://github.com/Yogu/itemfinder/releases/latest)

Simply open with Java, no installation required. (On OS X, download the zip file, extract it and start the .app file).

How it works
------------

This tool scans your minecraft worlds for items that lie on the ground and displays them
in a sortable list. The default ordering shows items that have been recently dropped at
the top, so if you just died, your stuff should be easy to find. The coordinates will then
tell you exactly where you have to look for them. Keep an eye on the age, if it reaches 5:00,
the item will despawn.

Building

You need maven and java 1.7 installed. Then just do:

    mvn clean install

This will download the dependencies and create the file `target/itemfinder-xxx-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.
Just open this file with java.
